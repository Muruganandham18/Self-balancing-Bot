-----------------------------------------------------------Self-balancing-Bot---------------------------------------------------------
A two-wheel bot maintains gravity at the center of its body without losing its balance,this project is based on PID controller and IMU Sensors on Arduino.
SENSOR USED:
  MPU 6050 for calculating angle of inclination
2-Dc MOTORS with high torque gears
Dc motor driver- L298N used to control two dc motors with peak current of 2A.
3D printed Wheels are use for best stable performance of the bot
chassis were built with thin wooden board and long Nuts and Bolts
